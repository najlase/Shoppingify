# Shoppingify

The repository contains 3 directories: web frontend, mobile, API (modified backend).<br />
Note 1: I noticed that some of the user stories require adding new fields in the database (such as the fied status in the list to tell if it is active, completed or cancelled) so I added them along with some necessary routes such as item completion in a list.<br />
Note 2: For the mobile application it is **necessary to update the consts.js** file to indiciate the correct IP for the backend.
